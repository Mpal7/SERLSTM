TO DO:
- try recursive feature elimination
-add evalutate() in lstm_kfold_padded

## 2020-04-07
### Added
- zcr functional for LLD Envelope

## 2020-04-09
### Changed
- window overlap 50% of window length for MFCC
### Added
- MFCC delta feature extraction
- MFCC delta delta feature extraction

##2020-04-10
### Added
-LLD pitch feature extraction, NB: must be called on audio with speech pauses , if called on VAD silence pitch not accurate

##2020-04-12
### Added
-VAD detector, to remove noise generated by silences (keeping pauses+chunks) --> useful for global feature analysis (frequency + time)

##2020-04-13
### Changed
-pre_proc_start() load file through parselmouth
-pre_proc_start() resampling through parselmouth
-pre_proc_start() to_mono through parselmouth
-pre_proc_start() writing preproc file through parselmouth

##2020-04-14
###Added
- LLD intensity feature extraction
- LLD formant feature extraction
- VAD detector, to remove noise generated by all silences (keeping only chunks)
- VAD detector, added

##2020-04-15
### Changed
- VAD pause detection x<150ms , average human pause in speech 170ms and removed silences at the edges
- changed low level formants feature extraction, extracts f1,f2,f3,f4  only at glottal pulse
### Added

##2020-04-17
### Changed
- LLD formant feature extraction to get F123 for each frame instead of glottal pulses

##2020-04-22
###Changed
- LLD intensity feature extraction for each frame with same window of the other

##2020-04-24
###Added
- LLF reshaping for RNN feeding, 13mfcc,13dmfcc,1 pitch, 1 intensity, 3 formants, 31llf--> (420,Tx,31)

##2020-04-29
##changed
- LLF reshaping takes into account slight different frame length caused by centering of the first frame, and makes everything equal to build matrix

##2020-04-30
##added
-RNN basic model INPUT LSTM + OUTPUT DENSE

##2020-05-01
##added
-data padding and a masking layer to ignore pads, this allows to process with minibatches

##2020-05-12
##added
-added X input transformation to allow also bucketing and padding, need to make it work

##2020-05-13
##added
- added train_on_batch to allow batches of different timesteps

##2020-05-12
##added
-Kfold stratified cross fold validation

##2020-05-12
##added
-batch training with butcketing and padding

##2020-05-21
##changed
-weights now reset between each folder of cross validation
-adjusted silence removal to be less aggressive, denoising done before.
-changed masking value for padding to 0, becouse -10 seems to be an actual value
##added
-test_on_batch

##2020-05-21
##added
-pydubfeature extraction
-mean across frames for ml alghoritms
-added random forest, decision tree, SVM

##2020-06-18
-added CNN model
-added feature extraction for random forest, decision tree, svm

##2020-06-23
-addedd augmented data

##2020-01-07
##added
new LSTM model (utilities_test.py) with new database EMODB, very good results on this database, for this reason checking
on previous LSTM model (rnn.py) performance with EMODB database. Performance so far is decent 0.60 acc with batch = 1,
not good with minibatches and online, therefore need to check if padding messes up the results

##2020-09-07
##added
- Data padding and augmentation to hard drive for parselmouth
- formants and pitch extraction
- early stopping

##2020-14-07
##changed
-removed bucketing+padding and left only padding, works well
##added
-log filter bank energy feature, does not perform well
-added first and second derivatives
-called twice pitch augmentation becouse otherwise it's the same pitch
-added epoch retriever if ES is triggered

##2020-17-07
##added
-Saved best model for ES

##2020-08-05
##added
-formants pitch intensity
-augmentation for full padding

##2020-09-05
##changed
-prints
##added
-pysptk for lpc feature extraction

##2020-09-10
##added
-lpcc extraction using pysptk
##changed
-feature extraction for independent analysis (not requiring mfcc to be present)
